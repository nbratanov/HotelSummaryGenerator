Arrived at the hotel at 14.30 and the staff advise the room wasn\u0027t ready. Had to wait in the lobby for 40 minutes along with other guests who were also told to wait. \r\n\r\nI currently sleep on a mattress that is around 9-10 years old and is ten times more comfy than what they were using.\r\nWould also like to point out I ordered one of the deluxe rooms so I was expecting something semi decent for the price I paid.\r\n\r\nRoom was cleaned daily. I speak fluent bulgarian but am not bulgarian myself. So I heard EVERYTHING they was saying about me and my wife behind our backs. They complained about their jobs having to serve us etc.\r\nEven though the room was cleaned on a daily basis. I found a couple of cockroaches in the room.\r\nOne in the actual bed and one under the sink. Whether the maid decided to do this as vengeance or not i have no idea.\r\n\r\nI was also locked out of my room without explanation. After going to the reception they advised about some fees that needed to be paid before unlocking the room after three days of already being there?\r\nThey could\u0027ve left all the fees and other costs until the end of my holiday and relaxation rather than making me deal with it or not giving me access to my room.\r\n\r\nThe card also failed to provide electricity to the room.\r\nHad to report this to the reception for them to supply me with another card key to activate the electrics in the room.\r\n\r\nOverall, go somewhere else. You\u0027ll pay for unfriendly service and disappointment.","response":{"author":"Zhivko Zhelyazkov","text":"Dear Stephen,\r\nI can’t accept your assessment and comment as objective because I have double checked in our books and did not find the guest complain on your name (or Stephen is not your name, as we know)!\r\nDear Mr. TRUONG, I am sorry to hear that you weren\u0027t satisfied with the competence of our housekeeping and front desk teams, but I\u0027d explain something.

We have a policy for a different price for one and two guests and you could check this on Expedia.
